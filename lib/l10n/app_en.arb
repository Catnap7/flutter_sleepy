  "effects_sleepQuality_desc": "Pink noise can encourage deeper sleep and improve overall sleep quality. You may sleep longer and wake feeling more refreshed.",
  "effects_focusMemory_desc": "Quality sleep optimizes brain function. Pink noise is associated with improved memory and learning, helping better focus when awake.",
  "effects_tinnitus_desc": "Pink noise can act as gentle background sound that makes intrusive ringing less noticeable.",
  "effects_stress_desc": "Soft, steady sound helps calm the mind. Try pink noise to relax body and mind.",
  "how_bullet_1": "Pink noise features a 1/f power spectrum: stronger low frequencies and gradually decreasing energy toward higher frequencies.",
  "how_bullet_2": "This spectral profile helps the brain perceive predictable patterns, making sudden external noises feel less disruptive.",
  "how_bullet_3": "As a result, it can reduce arousal frequency and help stabilize deeper sleep stages.",
  "tips_bullet_1": "Start with low volume and increase slowly. Aim for softer than conversation, like a gentle breath.",
  "tips_bullet_2": "For sleep mode, try a 30–60 minute timer by default; play all night if needed.",
  "tips_bullet_3": "Speakers or sleep speakers are often more comfortable than earphones.",
  "faq_q1": "How is it different from white noise?",
  "faq_a1": "White noise distributes equal power across frequencies, while pink noise follows 1/f with stronger lows. Pink noise often sounds less sharp and more natural.",
  "faq_q2": "How loud should I set it?",
  "faq_a2": "Too loud can be counterproductive. Keep it clearly below conversation level—present but never distracting.",
  "faq_q3": "Earphones vs speakers?",
  "faq_a3": "Most people find speakers more comfortable, but it depends on your noise environment and personal preference."
